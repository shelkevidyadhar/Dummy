The transmitting features of GPS positioning can be acquired on the basis of online communication behavior generated by intelligent terminals.The second step falls on capturing trafﬁc ﬂow with testing system, followed by obtaining the relation between longitude, latitude and IPv4 address through data analysis methods. Therefore, the delicate IP geolocation technology will be ﬁnally achieved. In conclusion, the system mentioned in this paper can achieve the goal of capturing, analyzing and storing GPS trafﬁc packages in real time. It will also constantly record the changing of longitude and latitude where the IP address is located for several times. The location result or the longitude and latitude changing range which has been afﬁrmed for many times will lead to accurate location. After a long standing accumulation, it is predictable that the result in this thesis can be able to enhance the accuracy of geographical location technology. It applies to all IP address passing the testing system. Supplement and integration practice towards data in open source IP address library will be added as well by adopting data analysis method in the future. It can also be a reliable way of assessing the validity of IP address database for locating in other cases.
